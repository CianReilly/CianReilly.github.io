                <div class="col-12 col-md-6 pr-lg-4 mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p>For the software composition, an analysis of a number of Detroit techno productions was carried out to discover:</p><p>

1.	What sounds are distinct to Detroit techno.
</p><p>2.	Is there a common tempo to their songs.
</p><p>3.	What is the average duration of popular Detroit techno songs

.</p><p>From this analysis, it was found that the hi-hat, for most songs, had a quick tempo and the rhythm of it changes a few times within the song. The kick was heavy and the snare had a lot of attack. There are a number of other sounds that can be added into songs depending on the artist’s preference, cowbell, congas, toms and cymbals are four very common ones. </p><p>Logic Pro was the software used for the creation of the software composition, as the author of this project already had experience making music with this software, there are samples from some of the hardware instruments used to create Detroit techno already built in to the software and the built-in sampler, the EXS24, is easy to use.

 </p><p>The bass in Detroit techno usually created the main melody for the piece. To get a feel for what the bassline for the software composition could sound like, a number of Detroit techno tracks were referred to. Songs like NO UFO’S and Techno city have some funky synth bass in them, which is where the inspiration came from. The software composition has a high tempo bassline that sets the melody for the piece.

                <div class="col-12 col-md-6 pl-lg-4 mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p>The process for the hardware composition was quite different from the software. To record tracks using drum machines and analog synths you need to use control voltage (CV), which sets the tempo of the piece and controls the octave. For this part of the project, a Roland TR-606, an Arturia MiniBrute synthesizer and a Nord modular g2 synthesizer were used. </p><p>The control voltage is triggered by the low and high tom on the 606, so in order to play the synth in time with the drum machine you create a pattern on the drum machine, on the lo-tom or hi-tom setting, and as the sequencer runs it plays the pattern using whichever note has been pressed on the synth.</p><p>The Nord g2 was used for the pads on this track to fill up the sound and give it a more Detroit feel, as pads were a main feature of their tracks.

 On the 606, there is a control switch to flick between the different drum sounds it can create, kick, snare, lo-tom, hi-tom, cymbal, and two hi-hats. There is also an accent setting where you can add to the volume of each drum sound. Once you have the pattern you want created, the sequencer will run and play the pattern. The volume of each sound can also be changed using the control knobs at the top of the drum machine. </p><p>The process for this part of the project was to start off with only one or two drum sounds playing, while the others were turned all the way down, and then slowly introduce each sound one by one. The tempo for the track is set on the 606 also, using a knob to the left of the machine, but you can’t see the BPM of the track on the machine, so a BPM calculator needed to be used to set the correct tempo.
