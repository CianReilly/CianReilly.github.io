                <blockquote><p><span style="font-style: normal;">This project attempts to recreate the sounds of early Detroit techno using both hardware and software instruments. The research section of this project investigates the history and technologies of a group of producers from a town called Belleville, just outside Detroit, named The Belleville Three and how they created the sound of Detroit techno. It then examines the influence they have had on electronic music and other genres besides as well as two interviews with electronic music producers to get some insights into music production. </span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">The software composition was composed using Logic Pro and samples from hardware instruments that were used to create early Detroit techno. The hardware composition was recorded using a Roland TR-606 Drum Machine, an Arturia Mini Brute Synthesizer, a Nord modular g2 and was recorded in Pro Tools. Findings include the fact that software producers are more common today, as most people already have a laptop or computer and there is a multitude of music production softwareâ€™s that can be downloaded for both Mac and PC with built-in instruments that can be played through the keyboard. This is the easier option compared to buying a drum machine and synthesizer. The re-creation of Detroit techno was attempted by both compositions yet, in conclusion, the software piece has more sounds distinct to Detroit techno than the hardware one as it was too costly to purchase a Roland TR-808 or TR-909, so the Roland TR-606 was used because it was available.</span></p></blockquote>
